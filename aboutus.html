    <p>SignUpForGood was created to make it easier for people to volunteer.

    <p>The problem:</p>

    <p>Finding opportunities and organizations is easy enough. Actually signing up to volunteer, however, is often a hassle.</p>

    <p>Volunteers have to proactively reach out to coordinators. Having to email someone for basic information -- e.g. whether an event is actually happening or an organization still needs volunteers -- is a hassle that deters potential volunteers from following through.</p>

    <p>Our solution:</p>

    <p>What if we made the process more transparent? Ideally, people would be able to see everything they want to know about a volunteer opportunity, and then be able to sign up right away!</p>

    <p>SignUpForGood eliminates unnecessary back-and-forths between volunteers and coordinators. Volunteers can easily get involved with organizations they care about. Coordinators deal with less administrative work.</p>

    <p>BOOM!</p>
